The Warganiser

Minimum requirements:
Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich)

The Warganiser is an app built to assist war gamers by allowing them to log their armies into a simple and easy to use database system and view it at any time.

To install, simply download the APK and run it on an Android platform device

The main Activity is the App's database input page, from here you can enter the Name and Type of unit being used, it will then be output onto the page in a text box under the inputs, it is now saved to your personal SQLite database.

The secondary activities include "Boltgun" which currently contains the lyrics to the popular Warhammer 40k Parody of Marty Robbin's "Big Iron", in the future this particular page will be used to reset the database and to delete entries into the Database. The other activity in this categories is a simple About screen with a small message from me about the app.
